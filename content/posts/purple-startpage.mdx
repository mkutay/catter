How to do UI design as a web developer takes some time to learn. While coding this website, I also decided to
other web app projects, and this is one of the first. It's a simple and an elegant way to surf the web.

I used <Link href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</Link> with <Link href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">Shadcn's UI components</Link>
for the buttons and the cards. This project allowed me to understand flex and grid items in CSS, which I was struggling 
with while developing this website. While I want to improve the website and allow more customisation for the end-user, I am
pleased with its current state as I did what I set out to do.
