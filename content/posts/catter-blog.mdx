I decided to open source my entire blog. I plan to write a blog post detailing why I came to this decision, but for now, 
you can read, fork, and contribute to my blog through the [repository](https://github.com/mkutay/catter).

This was the website that sparked my love for **building** and **creating**, using Next.js as a tool.
I created this minimal and responsive blog with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [MDX](https://github.com/ipikuka/next-mdx-remote-client), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Shadcn's UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.
The blog has a custom made comment system, a place where people can write an entry with customisation, and MDX support.

I learned so much by making this blog. This place was a way for me to tinker and try different stuff. While 
everything wasn't perfect (Xugro... He broke my guestbook system *twice*), I did my best to fix any breaking bugs
and make the website gorgeous. I also hope to improve the website further.
